# RunningKing — Generated project

Place your assets (bg.png, personrun.png, close.png, start.png, score.png, restart.png, join.png, again.png, +1.png, -1.png) into the `assets/` folder before running.

Open `index.html` locally or deploy to GitHub Pages.

If you want me to include your actual images into the Zip, upload them and I will regenerate the package.
